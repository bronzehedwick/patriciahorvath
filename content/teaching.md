I teach creative writing and literature at Framingham State University, Massachusetts. One of my courses, Disability in Literature and Culture, considers the ways in which disabled bodies are represented in literary texts. My interest in this subject stems from my experience with scoliosis and my curiosity about the relationship between disability and self-identity. It&#8217;s a topic I explore in my forthcoming memoir, _All the Difference_ (Etruscan Press).

I&#8217;ve given readings and presentations at The New York Public Library, Fashion Institute of Technology, SUNY Purchase, The Millay Colony for the Arts, The Hurston-Wright Foundation Conference at Virginia Commonwealth University, the Association of Writing and Writing Programs annual conference, and Bellevue Literary Review&#8217;s annual reading at Bellevue Hospital, Langone Medical Center in New York, among other venues.
