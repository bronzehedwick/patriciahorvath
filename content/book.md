## Synopsis

![All The Difference front cover](/images/all-the-difference-cover.jpg)
*All the Difference* is a captivating account of the author’s transformation from a visibly disabled young woman to someone who could, abruptly, “pass” for able-bodied. In prose that is searing and humorous Patricia Horvath details her experiences with bracing and spinal fusion, as she considers family dynamics, the literature of physical transformation, and how folk and fairy tales shape our attitudes towards the disabled.

<p>
I may as well admit it, I’m poorly put together.
My body leans sharply to the left. I’m brittle-
boned, stoop-shouldered, with an “S” shaped
spine. I cannot touch my toes, ice skate, or ride
a bike. My right shoulder blade and hipbone
stick out too far, and my right leg is a half-inch
shorter than my left. When I walk, my right foot
swings wildly to the side. On its own trajectory,
my foot will skim the sidewalk’s detritus: potato
chip bags, stones, bottle caps. My ex-boyfriend
called it my “trick foot.” We’d pass, say, a dented
car or battered-looking hydrant. “Look what
the trick foot did!” he’d exclaim and I’d laugh,
wanting to be a good sport. It’s important to
be seen as a good sport when one is, in fact,
completely unathletic.

The hard plastic corset buckled in back with a
thick leather strap. Attached to this new torso
were metal suspenders. I stepped into the
brace, put my arms through the suspenders,
and grabbed the dresser for support. My mother
tugged and tugged. The strap was heavy;
it had no give. This was her first attempt at
shackling me, and she was having trouble. The
corset bumped against my hips. I sucked in
my stomach. My mother pulled harder on the
strap. I was a debutante being corseted for the
antebellum ball. She gave one final emphatic
tug and the brace shifted into place on my hips.
I could feel the strap buckling, a screw being
tightened at the back of my head. I looked at
my reflection, looked away. This was me now—
these metal bars, these bolts and screws. I
pulled up my jeans, but they wouldn’t fit over my
hips. My shirt was too tight to button.
The brace’s weight was incredible, a second
body to lug. I was tall and slim, but caged I was
a heavy, clunky thing. The corset made me
stick out in back. I needed pants large enough
to fit over my plastic torso, shirts that could
accommodate my metal shoulder blades. But
my limbs had not grown longer. My new,
double-digit sized clothes were too long in
the leg and arm. My mother spent evenings
hemming my jeans, but do hemmed Levis
ever look right?
</p>

<p>
Shirts were especially difficult. The brace had
numerous gadgets and straps. One white strap
cut across my abdomen, another attached to the
bars just above my clavicle and would peek out
from low-necked shirts. Even in summer I wore
turtlenecks and scarves.
