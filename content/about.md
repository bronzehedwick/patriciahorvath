Patricia Horvath's essays and stories have appeared in numerous literary journals, including _The Massachusetts Review_, _The Los Angeles Review_, _New Ohio Review_, _Shenandoah_, _Confrontation_, _The Laurel Review_, _2 Bridges Review_, and _Cream City Review_. She is the recipient of the _Bellevue Literary Review's_ Goldenberg Prize in Fiction for a story that was accorded a Special Mention in the 2013 Pushcart Prize anthology and of a Notable Essay designation in the 2016 edition of _Best American Essays_. Her memoir _All the Difference_ (Etruscan Press), for which she received fellowships from The New York Foundation for the Arts and the Barbara Deming Memorial Fund, explores the connection between disability and self-identity and what happens to one's sense of self when a physical disability ceases to be visible. She teaches at Framingham State University, Massachusetts and is an editor at _The Massachusetts Review_.
